		<h2> Then who are we? </h2>
		<p> LAMAR is a fledgling but innovative company. We are five in charge of this project: Lucas, Adèle, Manon, Antoine and Romain (LAMAR). Our goal is simple, to allow everyone to travel in better conditions. That’s why we decided to create a smart and connected suitcase following the smallest movements of its owner thanks to a bluetooth connection system. By buying our suitcase, you will no longer have to worry about carrying it, pushing and pulling it because it will follow you automatically!  </p>
